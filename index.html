        <h1><p style="text-align: center;">About Freedy</p></h1>
        <p>Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the world of Five Nights at Freddy’s 1. Today, we’re here to talk about one of the most iconic characters in the game, Freddy Fazbear himself.

            Freddy Fazbear is a lovable and friendly animatronic bear who loves to sing and dance. He’s the star of the show at Freddy Fazbear’s Pizza, and he’s always ready to entertain you with his musical talents.
            
            However, there’s more to Freddy than meets the eye. When the sun goes down and the lights go out, Freddy becomes something else entirely. He becomes a fierce and terrifying predator, stalking his prey through the dark and shadowy halls of the pizzeria.
            
            But don’t let that scare you away from Freddy. He’s still the same lovable bear you know and love, even if he does have a bit of a dark side. So come on down to Freddy Fazbear’s Pizza and see for yourself what all the fuss is about. You won’t be disappointed.</p>

            <h1><p style="text-align: center;">About Bonnie.</p> </h1>
            <p>"Bonnie the Bunny is the guitarist in Freddy’s band, positioned at the left side of the stage. Bonnie is an animatronic rabbit who, like the other animatronics in the game, is programmed to entertain children during the day. However, at night, Bonnie becomes more aggressive and will attempt to attack the player. Bonnie is known for his distinctive purple color and his ability to teleport around the pizzeria. He is also one of the most active animatronics in the game, along with Chica and Foxy. To survive the night, the player must keep track of Bonnie’s movements and use the security doors to keep him out of the office.

                Bonnie is one of the four original animatronics of Freddy Fazbear’s Pizza and a major antagonist in the Five Nights at Freddy’s series. He was the guitarist when the first Freddy Fazbear’s Pizza was opened in the 1980s 1. In 1987, he and the other original animatronics had all fallen into severe disrepair and Bonnie was replaced by his newer counterpart for the “improved” Freddy Fazbear’s Pizza, Toy Bonnie 12. After the pizzeria’s closing, he and the original animatronics were refurbished for the new pizzeria, as of the events of the first game 1.
                
                Bonnie is an indigo-colored animatronic rabbit with blue accents, magenta eyes, and a squarish muzzle. He sports long articulated ears that are capable of bending backwards and forwards and wears a red bowtie with a neck strap that is partially obstructed by his chin 1. While Bonnie appears purple in artworks and in Special Delivery, he’s shown to be more dark blue than purple in most of the games where he and his counterparts appear, including FNaF World 1.
                
                Bonnie is one of the most active animatronics in the game, along with Chica and Foxy. He has the ability to teleport around the pizzeria, which makes him difficult to track. He will often appear in the West Hall or the West Hall Corner, and he can also appear in the Office if the player doesn’t keep track of him 1. Bonnie is also known for his distinctive jumpscare, which involves him lunging at the player with his mouth open and his eyes glowing 1.
                
                To survive the night, the player must keep track of Bonnie’s movements using the cameras and the lights. The player can use the lights to check if Bonnie is in the West Hall or the West Hall Corner, and they can use the doors to keep him out of the Office. However, the doors use up power, so the player must use them sparingly 1. If Bonnie manages to enter the Office, the player will be jumpscared and the game will end.</p>

                <H1> <p style="text-align: center;">About Chica.</p></H1>
                <p>"Chica the Chicken, also known as Chica, is one of the four original animatronics of Freddy Fazbear’s Pizza and a major antagonist in the Five Nights at Freddy’s series. Chica is an animatronic chicken and the backup singer in Freddy’s band, positioned at the right side of the stage. Undisclosed to Fazbear Entertainment, Inc. and to the public, Chica and the other original animatronics are possessed by children murdered by a man named William Afton. Due to this, she and the others are now seeking revenge against their killer by attacking any adults in the pizzeria after-hours in blind rage.

                    Chica is a bright yellow animatronic chicken with a spherically-shaped head, orange beak, magenta eyes, and black eyebrows. On the top of her head are three “tufts” of feathers. She has two talons from each of her orange feet. She wears a white bib that reads “LET’S EAT!!!” in yellow bubble letters, outlined in purple, with the bib flecked with tricolored triangles in patterns of three, and what appear to be tiny stylized pizza slices 1.
                    
                    Chica is known for her love of pizza, and she can often be found in the kitchen of the pizzeria. She is also known for her distinctive jumpscare, which involves her lunging at the player with her mouth open and her eyes glowing 1.
                    
                    To survive the night, the player must keep track of Chica’s movements using the cameras and the lights. The player can use the lights to check if Chica is in the East Hall or the East Hall Corner, and they can use the doors to keep her out of the Office. However, the doors use up power, so the player must use them sparingly 1. If Chica manages to enter the Office, the player will be jumpscared and the game will end.
                    
                    Chica is a major character in the Five Nights at Freddy’s series, and she has appeared in several of the games and spin-offs. She is a fan favorite among players, and her love of pizza has become a popular meme in the gaming community 1.</p>

                    <H1><p style="text-align: center;">About FOXY.</p></H1>
                    <p>"Foxy the Pirate, also known as Foxy, is one of the four original animatronics of Freddy Fazbear’s Pizza and a major antagonist in the Five Nights at Freddy’s series. Foxy is a discontinued animatronic pirate fox entertainer. He resides at his own separate stage in the pizzeria. Undisclosed to Fazbear Entertainment, Inc. and to the public, Foxy and the other original animatronics are possessed by children murdered by a man named William Afton. Due to this, he and the others are now seeking revenge against their killer by attacking any adults in the pizzeria after-hours in blind rage.

                        Foxy is a large, animatronic fox with crimson, tattered fur. He has yellow eyes, red eyebrows, and three strings of hair from the top of his head. He has a hook for his right hand and his left hand has been worn down to the endoskeleton. He also bears an eye patch that is folded over his right eye, although he is usually seen with it above his eye rather than covering it 1.
                        
                        Foxy is known for his speed and agility, and he can often be found running down the West Hall towards the player’s office. He is also known for his distinctive jumpscare, which involves him lunging at the player with his mouth open and his eyes glowing 1.
                        
                        To survive the night, the player must keep track of Foxy’s movements using the cameras and the lights. The player can use the lights to check if Foxy is in the West Hall or the West Hall Corner, and they can use the doors to keep him out of the Office. However, the doors use up power, so the player must use them sparingly 1. If Foxy manages to enter the Office, the player will be jumpscared and the game will end.
                        
                        Foxy is a major character in the Five Nights at Freddy’s series, and he has appeared in several of the games and spin-offs. He is a fan favorite among players, and his speed and agility have made him one of the most challenging animatronics to avoid in the game 1.</p>

                        <h1><p style="text-align: center;">About Golden Freedy.</p></h1>
                        <p>Golden Freddy, also known as Yellow Bear, is a mysterious animatronic in the Five Nights at Freddy’s series. He is a golden-colored version of Freddy Fazbear and is one of the secret animatronics in the game. Golden Freddy is known for his ability to teleport and his unique jumpscare, which involves him suddenly appearing in the player’s office.

                            In Five Nights at Freddy’s, Golden Freddy can appear in the player’s office if certain conditions are met. When he appears, the game will freeze for a few seconds, and the player will be jumpscared by Golden Freddy. Golden Freddy’s jumpscare is unique in that it doesn’t involve him lunging at the player like the other animatronics. Instead, he simply appears in front of the player, causing the game to end.
                            
                            Golden Freddy’s backstory is shrouded in mystery, and his role in the game is not fully understood. Some fans speculate that he is a hallucination or a ghost, while others believe that he is a physical animatronic that has been possessed by a vengeful spirit. Whatever the case may be, Golden Freddy remains one of the most enigmatic and intriguing characters in the Five Nights at Freddy’s series</p>
